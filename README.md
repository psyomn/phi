This is very barebones. Use at your own risk. Please only use at home.

Is a family photo backup tool. Originally is supposed to be an
alternate way to sync photographs from different devices.

Use cases:
- be mainly for personal use, on self hosted server/home server
- be secure-ish
- support multiple users (no sharing with each other though)
- not supposed to be for more than 10 users
- very little concurrency concerns
